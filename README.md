This project, AJTPROJET, is a web-based food ordering system developed using Java Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. It allows users to browse food categories, search items, and place or cancel orders through an interactive web interface. The backend logic is handled with Java classes, while database connectivity is managed using the MySQL Connector. The project structure follows a standard NetBeans web application format, including build and deployment configurations (build.xml, web.xml). This setup demonstrates a complete end-to-end implementation of an online food ordering platform.
